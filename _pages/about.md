Welcome to Vemana's Space. I am Subrahmanyam, a Staff Software Engineer at Google. This is where I write about anything that catches my fancy. That may or may not include Software Engineering, Math, Life & Laughter. All opinions are my own and offered without guarantee.

## What's **Vemana**? 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemana">Vemana</a> is a Telugu poet particularly known for short, rythmic, life-lesson poems. His most famous work is **Vemana Sathakam** comprising 100 poems each of which is 3 short lines long completed by a final 4th signature line.

**Example**
```
Alpudepudu palku aadambaramugaanu         A smaller person speaks pompously
Sajjanundu palku challagaanu              An accomplished person speaks measuredly
Kanchu mroginatlu kanakambu mrogunaa      Brass is louder than Gold
Viswadaabhiraama vinura vema              Signature line
```


## **Why** Vemana?
Briefly,
* Vemana's poems manage to convey exceptional life-lessons in 3 eminently recallable lines of about 5 words each
* Many complex topics appear to have a `compressed, mostly correct & recallable` explanation using a branching factor of 3, albeit building upon other constructs. For example, 
  * Newton's laws are recallable because they are small (3) in number and build upon constructs like Calculus
  * Distributed Consensus problem only has 3 constraints (`Termination, Agreement & Validity`)
* 3 appears to be a sweet spot for humans (or just me?)
  * Less than 3 appears insufficient while more than 3 seems difficult to remember/reason even if some theories like Group Theory require more axioms 
  * My technical summaries - both for myself & others - usually keep to a branching factor of 3
  * Even *Why Vemana?* requires only a branching factor of 3
