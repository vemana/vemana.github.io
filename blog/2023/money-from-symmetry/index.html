So, there has to be a better explanation.</p> <hr> <h2 id="breaking-circularity-using-symmetry">Breaking circularity using Symmetry</h2> <p>The root of the circular argument appears to be the asymmetric nature of the mortgage transaction. Pay attention to how we describe it: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The bank gave John money</code>. This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_relation" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">asymmetric relation</a> because if we swap the bank and John, the statement would no longer be true <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">John gave the bank money</code>.</p> <p>This observation prompts the key question:</p> <blockquote class="block-warning"> <p>How can we describe the mortgage transaction as a Symmetric relationship; that is, if we swap the Bank and John, the description should still be true ?</p> </blockquote> <p>My first attempt at answering this also turned out to be insightful.</p> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <p>The bank and John enter a contract. Alternatively, John and the Bank owe each other something. <br> <br> Note how the statement is symmetric. Swapping bank and John in the statement doesn’t change it!</p> </blockquote> <p>That’s symmetric alright. But, what do they owe each other? This line of inquiry proved productive.</p> <hr> <h2 id="liabilities-contracts-and-assets">Liabilities, Contracts and Assets</h2> <p>The symmetric answer can be simply restated as: <strong>In any transaction like the mortgage, the two parties are exchanging obligations.</strong>.</p> <p>Upon some reflection, we can arrive at the following insights, which we’ll explore in this section:</p> <ul> <li>Everyone can create/make a promise aka obligation <ul> <li>Liability is just another name for this promise</li> <li>Liability is the most primitive economic unit in any society. It costs nothing to make a promise - the trouble is finding someone to accept your promise!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Two parties can decide to accept each other’s Liability <ul> <li>This exchange of liabilities is a Contract</li> <li>Economy runs on Contracts</li> </ul> </li> <li>One party’s liability is the other party’s asset <ul> <li>All your assets are somebody’s liabilities!</li> <li>This may be surprising, but it really is so! Some liabilities have such low performance risk we don’t even contemplate non-performance</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="common-liabilities">Common Liabilities</h3> <p>With this in mind, we are ready to probe some standard liabilities we encounter. For each liability, we should be able to ask:</p> <ul> <li>Who is the liability issuer?</li> <li>What does that liability promise?</li> <li>Is there a risk of non-performance?</li> </ul> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Liability</th> <th style="text-align: left">Issuer</th> <th style="text-align: left">Liability of the issuer</th> <th style="text-align: left">Non-performance Risk</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">US Govt. bond</td> <td style="text-align: left">US Treasury</td> <td style="text-align: left">A US Govt. bond pays interest &amp; principal to the holder at a pre-determined schedule</td> <td style="text-align: left">Missed payments and/or principal.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">US Dollar</td> <td style="text-align: left">Federal Reserve (Fed)</td> <td style="text-align: left">If you present 10$, Fed promises to give you 2x5$ (as funny as it sounds).

Other than that, there’s nothing that the Fed promises on its US$ liability to a good approximation. They can print more of it with relatively little interference.</td> <td style="text-align: left">The Fed itself can always perform (exchanging 10$ for 2x5$), but US Treasury may accept a competing legal tender, can abolish taxes reducing need for US$ etc</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Apple Stock</td> <td style="text-align: left">Apple Corporation</td> <td style="text-align: left">Apple corp promises to share dividends equally across all equity holders &amp; guarantees equal voting rights.

JPM’s checking account merely promises that on-demand it will be able to obtain those US$. It is entirely possible that JPM fails to honor this promise. So, 100$ in JPM checking account is not the same thing as 100$ in BofA checking account.

Similarly, the Fed can print more US$ and dilute the existing US$.</p> <hr> <h3 id="contracts-exchange-of-liabilities">Contracts: Exchange of Liabilities</h3> <p>Contracts are just an exchange of liabilities. Typically there are two parties. Some examples to illustrate.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Contract</th> <th style="text-align: left">Party 1 &amp; Obligation</th> <th style="text-align: left">Party 2 &amp; Obligation</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">$1M Mortgage between JPM and John Doe</td> <td style="text-align: left">JPM promises to increase John Doe’s checking account by $1M</td> <td style="text-align: left">John Doe promises to pay interest &amp; principal per agreement.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Aging parent &amp; child (provocative to showcase the nature of contracts)</td> <td style="text-align: left">Parent promises to bequeath wealth upon passing.</td> <td style="text-align: left">Child promises to take care of parent in advanced years.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr> <h3 id="assets-somebodys-liabilities">Assets: Somebody’s liabilities</h3> <p>A contract is simply an exchange of liabilities. However, it creates both an asset and liability for both parties.

This is the basis of double-entry book-keeping.</p> <hr> <h2 id="no-more-circularity">No more circularity</h2> <p>The fundamental unit of the economy is contracts. Something as simple as buying a chair involves a contract. John Doe sends US$ (Fed’s liability) and the manufacturer sends the chair (manufacturer’s liability) with a promise that it will work as advertised. If the chair doesn’t, it perhaps comes with a warranty which is analogous to credit risk in a bond.</p> <p>Most money is just bank credit &amp; it gets created by a bank on demand. For example, when John buys a chair using his credit card, JPM simply creates a liability for John and credits the chair manufacturer’s checking account. No US$ is involved at all.</p> <p>There’s a bit more to this story, including what happens when the chair manufacturer’s account is in BofA &amp; John’s card is JPM - it does involve transferring US$ (so called reserves) from JPM to BofA but in the background.</p> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <p>The economy is NOT dependent on a circular rotation of some limited resource called money, but it progresses via a SEQUENCE of contracts. There’s no confusion on how money’s circulating - it is not going round &amp; round; it is just being created freshly. New contracts (e.g. credit) may be created to service old contracts.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="illustration-treasury-transfer-payments">Illustration: Treasury Transfer payments</h2> <p>What happens when the Treasury makes transfer payments (i.e. free distributions) to citizens? To a good approximation, this is what happens</p> <ul> <li>The Treasury holds its checking account with the Fed. It’s called TGA (Treasury General Account)</li> <li>Treasury instructs the Fed to transfer $1000 from its TGA to JPM for the benefit of John Doe</li> <li>Fed transfers $1000 from TGA to JPM</li> <li>JPM credits $1000 to John Doe’s checking account</li> </ul> <p>You may have noticed that there are a bunch of uni-directional transfers which contradicts our insistence that each Contract (or Transaction) is an exchange of Liabilities! It turns out that our theory correctly predicts the existence of offsetting liabilities. So, I depict each transaction as an exchange of liabilities. The <em>fictional</em> Goodwill liability of John Doe is quite a standard accounting entity.</p> <blockquote class="block-danger"> <p>Note: This is an approximation to help our understanding.

This section starts with a recap and concludes with some takeaways and follow-up questions.</p> <h2 id="recap">Recap</h2> <p>A quick recap of the entire thought process from beginning to end</p> <ul> <li>I started with the question <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What is money?</code> </li> <li>To make progress, I asked a strawman question <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What happens when John Doe takes a mortgage?</code> </li> <li>Even after more than an year of pondering on and off, I couldn’t answer the strawman convincingly</li> <li>Eventually, I added a constraint: any answer to this question must only use symmetric phrases - banning asymmetric phases like give, take, lend, owe, etc.</li> <li>As it turned out, this symmetry constraint unlocked the whole mystery &amp; within a matter of an hour, the primary concepts all became clear</li> </ul> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2> <ul> <li>A Liability is just a promise - everybody can create one, but it acquires value only when it can be exchanged for another liability. This exchange of Liabilities is a Contract. <ul> <li>For every liability, there is a clear <strong>Issuer</strong> and a clear definition of what the liability entails</li> <li>US$ is the Fed’s liability, not the US Govt.’s. Fed is ostensibly an independent entity distinct the US Govt</li> <li>It just so happens that most human contracts (like mortagages) are written in US$; they could also be written in any other liability, like Gold, Bitcoin or JPM Checking Account etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Your assets are always somebody else’s liabilities <ul> <li>100 US$ in JPM checking account is not the same as 100 US$ in BofA checking account - they are both liabilities of the respective banks</li> <li>Human knowledge of natural sciences is a fantastic asset because it is mother nature’s liability which she honors in eternity with close to 0 performance risk. Most human contracts are very limited in their time. There’s a risk that humans misunderstood the liability (for e.g. Newton’s laws are inaccurate), but that is not mother nature’s responsibility</li> </ul> </li> <li>Democracy and mass bankruptcy are incompatible <ul> <li>When a large pct of population is unable to honor their contracts (like mortages), Democracy votes (indirectly) for reducing the contract burden</li> <li>Since most contracts are written in US$, cheapening US$ makes it easier to honor the contract</li> <li>Naturally, all Democratic Fiat currencies tend to 0 over time</li> <li>Since they cannot be cheapened on demand, hard currencies like Gold &amp; Bitcoin can force massive bankruptcies &amp; recessions; this appears to be the lived history on the Gold standard.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2 id="follow-up-questions">Follow-up questions</h2> <p>Armed with this knowledge, we can ask a bunch of follow-up questions. We can offer very reasonable answers to these questions but they are posts in their own right.</p> <ul> <li>What is a good economy? <ul> <li>Hint: One that’s confidently entering a lot of contracts!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is bitcoin better than US$ for the economy? <ul> <li>Hint: Does it help enter more contracts? What happens during a recession - is it good or bad that Fed can print US$?</li> </ul> </li> <li>What is Quantitave Easing? <ul> <li>Is it a good or bad experiment?
