# Problem Statement
Every software engineer wants to write good quality tests. But, what is a *good quality* test? Most answers to this question fall in the realm of *opinion*. Even if backed by experience, opinions are just that - they don't have backing in sound reasoning. So, can we offer a more objective standard for answering whether a test is a *good quality test* ?
