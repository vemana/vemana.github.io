## Context

Series convergence arguments using geometry tend to be particularly beautiful. I came across this a competition problem which admits an unusual, pretty argument.

## Problem

This is from Putnam 2021, problem A3.

Let $$a_0 = \pi/2$$ and let $$a_n = sin(a_{n-1})$$ for $$n \ge 1$$. Determine whether the following series converges:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^2
$$

## Solution

This is my handwritten solution; it leaves out some facts without quoting them or proving them (exercise for reader!) such as:
* $$a_n$$ is monotonically decreasing
* $$sin(x)/x$$ monotonically increases to 1 as x decreases from $$\pi/2 \to 0$$ (bounds excluded)
* $$sin(x) \gt x - x^3/6$$ for $$ 0 \lt x \lt 1 $$
* If a series $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty s_n, s_n \gt 0$$ is such that $$\exists p \ge 1: \forall r \ge p, (\sum_{i=r}^\infty s_n) > k$$ for some fixed $$k \gt 0$$, then the series diverges

The solution converts the recursive structure in $$x_n = sin(x_{n-1})$$ to a series of arc lengths on the unit circle and the series sum $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^2$$ can then be compared to the arc areas.
